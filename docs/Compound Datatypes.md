### Arrays

Arrays are declared and manipulated using square brackets. They support various operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements.

### Rules:

- Arrays can contain elements of mixed types.
- Operations like `PushFront`, `PushBack`, `Insert`, and `Remove` modify the array.
- Accessing an invalid index will throw an error.

**Examples:**

```prog
var array arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.PushBack(4); /> Adds 4 to the end
display arr[2]; /> Displays 3
arr.Remove(1); /> Removes the element at index 1
display arr.Length; /> Displays the length of the array
```
